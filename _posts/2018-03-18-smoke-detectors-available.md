Did you know that fires are twice as deadly in homes without smoke detectors?ยน

Barton Fire Department is providing free smoke detectors for residents of Barton while supplies last. If your smoke detectors are 10 years old or more, they should be changed. Please [contact us](https://www.facebook.com/bartonvolunteerfiredepartment/) to schedule a free installation today.
